## General Requirement

The requirement I had in mind is that the website must be fast and responsive, have some simple animations, and easy to edit for a non-technical person.

## Stack Explanation

After checking several headless cms, I decided to choose Prismic because of its simple and intuitive content editor and its generous pricing.

I wanted the site to have some simple animation too, I used Framer Motion for that.

CSS in js is my go-to for styling in React apps. Great things have been said about it already, and my preferred tool for that is Styled-components, mainly because it lets you write actual CSS and it's popular.
